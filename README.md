# Python Encryptor/Decrypter Program

This is a simple encryptor/decrypter program I made using Python. 

The way this program works, is you'll be given a prompt, with what you want to encrypt. 

After that, the program will provide you with a code that you can use, to decrypt your text. When you use the decrypt command, then you get your text back.


#### **I plan to remake this project, except way better, and using styled GUIs, so everything looks better.**
